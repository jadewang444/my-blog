name: Release (disabled)

# This workflow was disabled because it requires write permissions to PRs
# which may cause failing runs. The file was renamed to prevent it from
# automatically running on push. If you want to re-enable, restore the
# filename to `release.yaml` or adjust the `on:` trigger and permissions.
