My name is Wang Shiyu. "Jade" is my English name, from "Yu," which means precious jade, and "Shi," which means poetry.

I was born in Wuchang District, Wuhan, at 15:15 on November 28, 2000. Maybe that's one reason I've always liked winter. When I was six, I started learning ballroom dance. My wish back then was simple: I just wanted to dance forever. I attended elementary school in Wuchang, a good public school under a central state-owned enterprise. In fifth grade, I had my first "highlight moment" of student life: I got first place in the entire grade for the first and only time. (I don’t really know how it happened either. If you ask me whether I studied very hard, it doesn’t seem like I did. My memories of childhood are starting to get blurry, but I remember I had a very good friend in elementary school. She was a particularly quiet and well-behaved girl, not like a troublemaker like me. She lived just across the street. Every time I argued with my parents, I would announce I was running off — I really liked keeping rabbits, so I always took my rabbit with me — and go to her place for a few hours, waiting for my mom to call me home for dinner. She played the piano and was very good at drawing. When I was at her house, I would usually listen to her practise for a while, and then we’d draw together.)
I’ve never been a particularly obedient little girl. Maybe because I’m an only child, my dad raised me a bit like a boy, and my mom spoiled me. My dad isn’t good with words, but I know he loves me — even during that time in China, when the preference for sons over daughters was pronounced. He doesn’t like taking photos, so we don’t have many pictures together. But it’s okay. I’ve never heard him say "I love you," but it’s okay, because I know he does.
Both my parents are well liked by everyone — my mom because of her good nature, and my dad because he’s always ready to lend money to people. He values friendship; whenever friends around him encountered difficulties and asked to borrow money, he would lend it, even though most of the money he lent out, we never managed to get back. But it’s okay, because he’s my dad.
I was called a wild child by the neighbours when I was little. But I was also told I was very pretty. My hair was a bit frizzy and curly; because of this, absolutely everyone, ever since I can remember, would compliment me, saying I looked like a doll. I guess that’s why I’m a bit of a narcissist now... though some people say I’m not as pretty as I was when I was little. I don’t really mind.
After I got first place in fifth grade, my mom asked me what reward I wanted. I said I wanted a computer. Computers back then were the big desktop kind — with a tower, monitor, and keyboard — they took up a lot of space, nothing like laptops now. My mom thought a computer and new technology would help my studies. But then I started playing games. Fireboy & Watergirl: Fairy Tales was my favourite. And my grades fell. Well, maybe not fell off a cliff, but they dropped to around the middle of the class pretty fast.
I had been dancing since I was little, and the teachers at the dance club thought highly of me. I suppose I had some talent for it, and I enjoyed it. I entered lots of competitions and won quite a few trophies and medals. So I started thinking about becoming a professional dancer. When I get an idea, I like to act on it. (My mom was so indulgent; she always went along. My dad might say something, but he never really stopped me.) So I told my mom I wanted to be a dancer. She started looking into it and found out that art students could get into top universities through a special admission programme, similar to how athletes are recruited by universities in the United States. So she sent me to Wuhan’s only sports dance school. It was a boarding school for both middle and high school. Our phones were confiscated every week during school days because they were considered a distraction. We were all about eleven years old, living away from home for the first time, and everyone was homesick. The academic workload and dance training were both heavy. Monday to Friday was usually a fifty-fifty split: dance in the morning, academics in the afternoon, or vice versa. Evenings were either more dance training or self-study sessions for homework. The first year of middle school was when the most people dropped out. We were all eleven-year-old girls, tired every day, and we cried a lot at the beginning. But strangely, I don’t regret it. That period taught me perseverance, endurance, and independence. You ask me if it was hard? A little, I suppose… the interactions with teachers and classmates, those short-lived crushes that went nowhere. But you ask if my youth was happy? I suppose a little, too. We were young, life was simple, and when you were dead tired, just listening to a favourite song or having a cup of milk tea could make you feel better. A walk on the sports field after evening study felt good. By ninth grade, I was kind of a key student for the teachers. My dance partner and I travelled to quite a few other cities for competitions; our best result was probably third place in the youth group of one of the country’s biggest ballroom competitions. I gradually started to see how brutal the competition was — it’s like, how many people in the world play tennis, but how many become famous champions? I began to think about quitting. I also knew I couldn’t just end my competition career and become a dance teacher, because my patience was too poor; I’d probably scare my students. I suppose I’ve learned a bit more patience over time; maybe that’s just part of growing up.
Then I spent two years in a daze. It was during my most rebellious phase. I drank, smoked, got into fights, and went clubbing. I became a problem student for the dean. How did I suddenly wake up? I really don’t know. I just remember one night I went out with friends and got completely drunk, and the next day I suddenly didn’t want to live like that anymore. I wanted to know if there was a more interesting way to live. So I went home and told my mom, "Mom, I want to study again." She said that was good and then found me an academic intensive training programme for art students. I spent a year there catching up on some of the academics I’d missed over the years. But no matter what, I just couldn’t get the hang of maths. The maths teacher there was very good. He probably saw I had no confidence, so he made me the class maths representative. I was shocked and understood that he wanted to encourage me to study maths hard. I did study hard, but I’d missed three whole years of lessons (I’d probably just slept in class every day), so my maths score in the Gaokao still wasn’t good. But I’m still grateful to that teacher. Thinking about it, my luck has always been pretty good. I have supportive parents. Even during my most rebellious phase, when teachers called home every other day saying I needed discipline and was lazy or unruly, my parents still saw me as their best child. They loved me just the same.
After the Gaokao, my scores were good enough to get into a regular university in Wuhan — the city where I was born, grew up, and had lived for almost eighteen years. Although I had travelled to many places, "living" and "travelling" are different after all. Maybe by then, the impulse to see other corners of the world had already taken root in my heart.
On Chinese New Year’s Day in 2017, I went to a mall near my home to buy cake or something else (I don’t remember anymore). It was only a twenty-minute walk, so I chose to walk. Chinese New Year is in early January. It had just snowed in Wuhan, and there was still some snow on the ground. I was wearing a down jacket and snow boots, with my wired earphones in, looping the song "Empty" on repeat. As I walked, it suddenly hit me: maybe what I wanted wasn’t just the spotlight on a stage, but to go out and see the world. So, right there, I started searching on my phone for information about studying abroad. I hesitated a bit between Germany and France and finally picked France (because I thought it seemed more romantic — probably the whole world thinks that).
I’m a doer. When I got home, I started planning right away: which agency to use, how much it would cost, what the timeline was. The next day, after I had all the information, I showed my plan to my mom. She just smiled and said, "Sounds good. Let’s do it then." She’s always been like that — supporting me and loving me no matter what. Sometimes I think how lucky I am to have parents who love me like this. That’s why I’m a particularly optimistic person, because I know, no matter what happens, my parents will always be there for me.
Next, I found an agency in Beijing. We worked out a plan suitable for me. That summer after the Gaokao, I went to a French language school they arranged, learning French from zero until winter came to Beijing. The school was next to Beijing Foreign Studies University. After class, I often ate at their cafeteria. There, I met a girl from Northeast China. We went to class together, memorised vocabulary, played badminton, went swimming, and often wandered around Beijing’s tourist spots on weekends. Thinking of that time now, it still feels like a warm memory. At the end of 2018, I passed the French exams and got my student visa for France. Then I bought a plane ticket to Grenoble to keep learning French for another year before university. Why Grenoble? Honestly, the agency arranged it; I didn’t think too much about it. So I arrived in France and kept studying French. French people talk very fast — nothing like the slow, clear pace of the teachers in Beijing. At first, I couldn’t understand anything. But as time went on and my vocabulary grew, my French got better and better.
I went back to China for the holidays at the end of 2019. My cousin is a doctor. When I told her I was coming home, she casually reminded me, "There’s been a virus appearing in Wuhan recently — seems a bit like pneumonia." I’m not a medical student, and during the SARS outbreak in 2003 I was only three, so I didn’t think it was a big deal. So I returned home. After I returned, I even went to Thailand with my mom for a week. About two days after we got back to Wuhan from Thailand, we got an emergency notice from the Chinese government: they were going to lock down the city because it was a highly infectious disease that required quarantine. My mom asked me, "Should we book a ticket back to France right now?" But I thought, "It can’t be that serious." I hadn’t seen my family in a long time and wanted to stay a bit longer, so I stayed in Wuhan. What happened next, nobody expected. COVID-19 was indeed highly contagious. All hospital beds in Wuhan were in critical shortage, and the news updated the infection and death counts every day. My flight was cancelled, Wuhan was sealed off, and because of the time difference, I couldn’t attend my online classes in France. I had to take a half-year leave of absence. I felt how fragile life is and how unpredictable things can be. But at the same time, I was quietly glad, because if the world was really going to end one day, as long as I was with my loved ones, I wouldn’t be afraid.
During the worst of COVID, we were locked down for about three months. Our neighbourhood wasn’t hit too badly, so buying food and groceries was still manageable. During those months, my mom and I finally started using the treadmill at home that had been sitting there gathering dust. I ran almost every day. After the pandemic, we’d both shed about five kilograms. That time taught me what cherishing the present means, and it made me believe even more that the point of life is to experience things.
As summer was ending, I booked another ticket and went back to France. In September 2020, I officially started my first year of university, majoring in Law. France uses the civil-law system, with its strict theories and clear legal codes. Back then, I was memorising articles, doing case analyses, and deconstructing legal precedents using syllogistic reasoning every day. That year, my French improved a lot — which makes sense when you’re reading French law books all day — to the point where I could even debate and write essays. At the end of the academic year, I successfully moved up to the second year. I liked law, but I gradually realised my interest in economics and finance was stronger. Maybe it was because my aunt and uncle liked trading stocks, or maybe I saw some financial movies and got fascinated by that world of risk and decision-making. So I decided to start over from first year, majoring in Economics, later specialising in Applied Economics and Data Analysis. When I chose Economics, I had my doubts; after all, I was neither a maths genius nor a computer whiz. But I’m a doer. If I want to do something, I’ll do it. This change probably came after the COVID pandemic. Life is so uncertain. If I want to say something, if I want to see someone, if I have a goal, I will definitely work hard to make it happen. I don’t want to have regrets.
A lot of people ask me if I like Grenoble. It’s not a big, bustling city, but it’s surrounded by mountains and lakes — a place full of nature. That’s where I started skiing. From 2021 onwards, I went with the university ski team almost every weekend, spending the whole day on the slopes. When you’re standing on top of a mountain and the only sounds around you are the wind and your skis carving through the snow, that’s when you realise how small humans are and how grand nature is. Because of my diligent and tireless skiing, my skill level progressed from beginner to being able to handle all slopes. (Of course, I still prefer to take black runs slowly. After all, I had a fall — a skiing accident in February 2023. I literally flew off the piste, probably tumbled a few times in the air. On impact, my goggles came off and landed right on my chin, cutting a gash about a centimetre deep. Blood was running from my chin down to my neck. I was lucky, like always. When I fell, I just happened to miss several large rocks right next to my landing spot. Luckily, I was okay. I’m also thankful to the doctor in L’Alpe d’Huez who stitched me up. She definitely knew a girl would care about scarring, so she was very careful and precise.)
After finishing my bachelor’s degree, I went to Paris for a Master of Science in Currency, Banking, Finance, and Insurance, choosing the Asset Management track. I lived there for a year. Although I had already visited Paris as a tourist in 2019, actually living there felt completely different. It was the first time I learned to slow down. I often went for walks in Paris — what the French call flâner — just wandering aimlessly, without a set destination, going wherever, and stopping at a café when I got tired. With no mountains around Paris for skiing, I started learning golf regularly. Back then, I played three times a week, keeping at it even when my schedule was tight. Many people don’t like the attitude of Parisians, but I personally found it okay; I suppose they just don’t try to be everyone’s cup of tea — and honestly, no one can.
I think there are good and not-so-good people everywhere. I love travelling, and I often travel alone. I’ve met many people, from all countries, regardless of nationality, race, or gender, who offered me help when I needed it, out of pure kindness, not for any reward. Those moments made me believe that human nature is fundamentally good. In the autumn of 2024, I heard about the MICEFA programme at a conference. It’s an exchange programme between Paris universities and North American universities. I applied to a few American universities: Pace University in New York, the University of Austin in Texas, and one in New Jersey (I can’t remember the name). At first, I was just trying my luck. Later, I got accepted, but ultimately those schools were full. My adviser of this program, who’s super nice, told me there were still spots in Ohio, USA, and at Laval University in Canada, if I still wanted to go. I finally chose Ohio. Now, I am in Ohio, in the final year of my MSc, majoring in Finance and Business Analytics.
This is roughly my story from birth until now. It’s not a legendary tale — just the story of an ordinary girl born in the year 2000 who, over the past two decades, has been slowly learning how to become herself.
This story is to be continued.
