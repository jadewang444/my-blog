## Why I write

I write and record to taste life twice.

<span class="huang-quote">The rain drenches me. I know it comes to touch me. I understand it comes from me. It wants to leave traces in this world. It wants to be seen. It wants proof of existence. It wants to flow through me, through you. Together, we will flow to the ocean.[^1]</span>
