Recently, I came across a sentence: “The moments you share with someone are enough.”

Yes, the world is too big, and many people drift apart without meaning to, like two irregular lines starting from different points, meeting, tangling, crossing for a moment in life, and then heading in different directions.

Yes, human beings are still too greedy, always searching for “forever.”

Yes, with everyone, just a few shared moments are enough. Those moments I can remember forever— some have started to blur with time, and I thought I had forgotten them, but on some random day, they suddenly flash back, sweeping over me like a tornado with the same beauty and intensity as back then. Those moments were too brilliant, too fiery— like fireworks, enough to light up my entire life.

Even if we drift apart, it’s okay, because maybe they appeared in my life just to walk with me for a certain part of the journey, and to say goodbye at the next turn. They were friends, lovers, or strangers I barely knew, but the parts of me that were changed because of their presence will stay with me forever on their behalf.

A day I once thought was so ordinary turned out to be not ordinary at all.
Maybe you only passed by my life— walked with me for a minute, or a day, or a month, or a year, or ten years.
I know it's perhaps hard for us to walk together again, but meeting you was truly wonderful.
