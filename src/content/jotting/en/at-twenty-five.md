My name is Wang Shiyu. "Jade" is my English name, from "Yu," which means precious jade, and "Shi," which means poetry.

I was born in Wuchang District, Wuhan, at 15:15 on November 28, 2000. Maybe that's one reason I've always liked winter.

When I was six, I started learning ballroom dance. My wish back then was simple: I just wanted to dance forever.

(Shortened for repo.)
