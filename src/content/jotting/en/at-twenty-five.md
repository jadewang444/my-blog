My name is Wang Shiyu. "Jade" is my English name, from "Yu," which means precious jade, and "Shi," which means poetry.

I was born in Wuchang District, Wuhan, at 15:15 on November 28, 2000. Maybe that's one reason I've always liked winter. When I was six, I started learning ballroom dance. My wish back then was simple: I just wanted to dance forever. I attended elementary school in Wuchang, a good public school under a central state-owned enterprise. In fifth grade, I had my first "highlight moment" of student life: I got first place in the entire grade for the first and only time. (I don't really know how it happened either. If you ask me whether I studied very hard, it doesn't seem like I did. My memories of childhood are starting to get blurry, but I remember I had a very good friend in elementary school. She was a particularly quiet and well-behaved girl, not like a troublemaker like me. She lived just across the street. Every time I argued with my parents, I would announce I was running off — I really liked keeping rabbits, so I always took my rabbit with me — and go to her place for a few hours, waiting for my mom to call me home for dinner. She played the piano and was very good at drawing. When I was at her house, I would usually listen to her practise for a while, and then we'd draw together.)
I’ve never been a particularly obedient little girl. Maybe because I’m an only child, my dad raised me a bit like a boy, and my mom spoiled me. My dad isn’t good with words, but I know he loves me — even during that time in China, when the preference for sons over daughters was pronounced. He doesn’t like taking photos, so we don’t have many pictures together. But it’s okay. I’ve never heard him say "I love you," but it’s okay, because I know he does.
Both my parents are well liked by everyone — my mom because of her good nature, and my dad because he’s always ready to lend money to people. He values friendship; whenever friends around him encountered difficulties and asked to borrow money, he would lend it, even though most of the money he lent out, we never managed to get back. But it’s okay, because he’s my dad.
I was called a wild child by the neighbours when I was little. But I was also told I was very pretty. My hair was a bit frizzy and curly; because of this, absolutely everyone, ever since I can remember, would compliment me, saying I looked like a doll. I guess that’s why I’m a bit of a narcissist now... though some people say I’m not as pretty as I was when I was little. I don’t really mind.
After I got first place in fifth grade, my mom asked me what reward I wanted. I said I wanted a computer. Computers back then were the big desktop kind — with a tower, monitor, and keyboard — they took up a lot of space, nothing like laptops now. My mom thought a computer and new technology would help my studies. But then I started playing games. Fireboy & Watergirl: Fairy Tales was my favourite. And my grades fell. Well, maybe not fell off a cliff, but they dropped to around the middle of the class pretty fast.
I had been dancing since I was little, and the teachers at the dance club thought highly of me. I suppose I had some talent for it, and I enjoyed it. I entered lots of competitions and won quite a few trophies and medals. So I started thinking about becoming a professional dancer. When I get an idea, I like to act on it. (My mom was so indulgent; she always went along. My dad might say something, but he never really stopped me.) So I told my mom I wanted to be a dancer. She started looking into it and found out that art students could get into top universities through a special admission programme, similar to how athletes are recruited by universities in the United States. So she sent me to Wuhan’s only sports dance school. It was a boarding school for both middle and high school. Our phones were confiscated every week during school days because they were considered a distraction. We were all about eleven years old, living away from home for the first time, and everyone was homesick. The academic workload and dance training were both heavy. Monday to Friday was usually a fifty-fifty split: dance in the morning, academics in the afternoon, or vice versa. Evenings were either more dance training or self-study sessions for homework. The first year of middle school was when the most people dropped out. We were all eleven-year-old girls, tired every day, and we cried a lot at the beginning. But strangely, I don’t regret it. That period taught me perseverance, endurance, and independence. You ask me if it was hard? A little, I suppose… the interactions with teachers and classmates, those short-lived crushes that went nowhere. But you ask if my youth was happy? I suppose a little, too. We were young, life was simple, and when you were dead tired, just listening to a favourite song or having a cup of milk tea could make you feel better. A walk on the sports field after evening study felt good. By ninth grade, I was kind of a key student for the teachers. My dance partner and I travelled to quite a few other cities for competitions; our best result was probably third place in the youth group of one of the country’s biggest ballroom competitions. I gradually started to see how brutal the competition was — it’s like, how many people in the world play tennis, but how many become famous champions? I began to think about quitting. I also knew I couldn’t just end my competition career and become a dance teacher, because my patience was too poor; I’d probably scare my students. I suppose I’ve learned a bit more patience over time; maybe that’s just part of growing up.
Then I spent two years in a daze. It was during my most rebellious phase. I drank, smoked, got into fights, and went clubbing. I became a problem student for the dean. How did I suddenly wake up? I really don’t know. I just remember one night I went out with friends and got completely drunk, and the next day I suddenly didn’t want to live like that anymore. I wanted to know if there was a more interesting way to live. So I went home and told my mom, "Mom, I want to study again." She said that was good and then found me an academic intensive training programme for art students. I spent a year there catching up on some of the academics I’d missed over the years. But no matter what, I just couldn’t get the hang of maths. The maths teacher there was very good. He probably saw I had no confidence, so he made me the class maths representative. I was shocked and understood that he wanted to encourage me to study maths hard. I did study hard, but I’d missed three whole years of lessons (I’d probably just slept in class every day), so my maths score in the Gaokao still wasn’t good. But I’m still grateful to that teacher. Thinking about it, my luck has always been pretty good. I have supportive parents. Even during my most rebellious phase, when teachers called home every other day saying I needed discipline and was lazy or unruly, my parents still saw me as their best child. They loved me just the same.
